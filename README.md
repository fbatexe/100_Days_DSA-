🚀 100 Days of DSA in C

This repository documents my journey through the 100 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C challenge, undertaken as part of a college-led learning initiative at UPES.
The objective of this challenge is to build strong fundamentals in DSA through consistent daily practice and logical problem solving using the C programming language.

📌 Objective

The core idea behind this initiative is consistency over intensity.
By solving DSA problems every day for 100 days, the focus is on:
Strengthening problem-solving skills
Understanding core DSA concepts deeply
Writing clean, structured, and efficient C code
This repository reflects a disciplined and progressive learning approach rather than just final results.

🧠 Concepts Covered

C programming fundamentals for DSA
Arrays, Strings, and Pointers
Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
Searching and Sorting Algorithms
Trees, Graphs, and related algorithms
Time and space complexity awareness
The difficulty level increases gradually to ensure strong conceptual clarity.

📈 Learning Outcome

This repository demonstrates:
Regular coding practice
Progressive improvement in DSA concepts
A structured and disciplined learning mindset

🤝 Notes

The solutions prioritize clarity and learning.
Optimizations and improvements are welcomed as understanding grows.
